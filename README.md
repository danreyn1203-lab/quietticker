# QuietTicker

Independent stock research, published in the open.

A single-author research site: every write-up states what was bought, when, at what
price, and what would prove the thesis wrong. No hype, no paywall, no affiliate links.

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript · Tailwind v4 (CSS-first,
no `tailwind.config.js` — theme tokens live in `src/app/globals.css`).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # then fill in the values
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## How content works

Articles are structured JSON, not Markdown — each one is a list of typed blocks
(prose, charts, tables, risk lists, sources) so the renderer can lay them out
consistently and the charts stay data-driven.

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/content/articles/*.json` | One file per research write-up |
| `src/content/research-log.json` | Dated journal entries + the companies on the homepage |
| `src/content/featured.json` | The homepage "closest look" spotlight |
| `src/lib/articles/types.ts` | The block model every article conforms to |
| `src/components/article/` | The renderer for each block type |
| `src/lib/searchIndex.ts` | Client-safe search index — **update by hand when adding an article** |
| `src/lib/holdings.ts` | The disclosed position shown on the homepage |

## Authoring

Sign in at `/admin` with `AUTHOR_PASSWORD`. Once signed in:

- every article page gets an **Edit** button → `/journal/[slug]/edit`
- `/admin/featured` sets the homepage spotlight
- `/admin/email` composes and sends the newsletter

Auth is a single HMAC-signed httpOnly cookie (`src/lib/auth.ts`) — one author, no
user table. Saves `PUT` to `/api/articles/[slug]`, which writes the JSON file.

## Readers

Anyone can read everything without an account. Signing up at `/signup` takes a
first name, an email, and a password. To prove the address is real, we email a
6-digit code (over the same SMTP as the newsletter — see below); entering it at
`/verify` confirms the account, signs them in, and subscribes that email
(confirmed opt-in — an unconfirmed sign-up is never added to the list). Returning
readers sign in with email + password at `/signin`. Readers get `/profile`,
signed with their first name as its logo, showing only their own name, email,
join date and subscription; they can sign out, resubscribe, or delete the
account (which unsubscribes them).

Passwords are hashed with **scrypt** (a per-account random salt) and only the
hash is stored — never the password. The verification code is stored only as an
HMAC, expires in 15 minutes, and burns after 5 wrong tries. Reader accounts live
in `src/content/readers.json` (git-ignored) via `src/lib/readers.ts`; the store
is local for now and moving it to a database later only touches that file.

A reader session is a different cookie from the author's, signed with a different
key, carrying role `reader`, so it can never satisfy `isAuthor()` — signing up
gives no path to the author tools. If SMTP isn't configured, the code can't be
emailed: it's printed to the server console (and returned by the API in
development only) so local testing still works. Sign-in never reveals whether an
email has an account (one generic error for wrong email or wrong password).

> **Note:** this is not yet a password *reset* flow. Someone who forgets their
> password can re-register the same (still-unverified) email, or — once a real
> reset is wanted — that's the natural next step, which needs the same SMTP.

## Newsletter

Subscribers are captured by `SubscribeForm` → `POST /api/subscribe` and stored in
`src/content/subscribers.json`. Sending goes through Nodemailer over plain SMTP
(`src/lib/email.ts`); each subscriber gets their own email rather than a shared
thread. **If SMTP is unset the app falls back to generating a `mailto:` BCC link**,
so nothing breaks in development.

The subscriber and broadcast stores are git-ignored on purpose — they hold real
email addresses. `*.example.json` shows their shape.

The author dashboard at `/admin` opens with an audience panel: readers signed
up, new this week, new this month, how many are on the email list, sign-ups per
week for the last eight weeks, and the most recent sign-ups.

## Daily prices

The disclosed position on the homepage prices itself from Yahoo Finance's public
chart endpoint — no API key, no account (`src/lib/quotes.ts`). The entry price
and date are fixed history in `src/lib/holdings.ts`; only the current price
moves.

Yahoo is a courtesy endpoint and rate-limits bursts, so the fetcher takes it
gently: one request per ticker per six hours, cached to
`src/content/quote-cache.json`, a 20-minute back-off after a failure, and the
last good price (with its real date) if a refresh fails. Nothing on the page is
ever undated, and the price never blocks a render.

Pages refresh the price on demand when the cache expires, so no scheduler is
required. If you want the refresh to happen at a fixed time instead, point a
cron at `GET /api/cron/refresh-quotes` with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET`
(a signed-in author can also call it).

## Environment

See `.env.local.example` for the full annotated list. Briefly:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Public base URL — drives canonical links, sitemap, Open Graph |
| `AUTHOR_PASSWORD` | Password for `/admin` |
| `AUTHOR_SESSION_SECRET` | Long random string that signs the login cookie |
| `SMTP_*`, `NEWSLETTER_FROM` | Newsletter delivery; leave blank for mailto fallback |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Optional bearer token for `GET /api/cron/refresh-quotes` |

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev     # dev server
npm run build   # production build
npm run start   # serve the production build
npm run lint    # eslint
```

## A note on the research

Everything published here is one person's opinion and personal position, not
financial advice. Figures are checked against primary sources at the time of
writing and dated; where a claim could not be verified it is labelled as such
rather than quietly dropped.
